Learning the Windows Registry is crucial for a cybersecurity professional. It enhances capabilities in threat detection, compliance, and forensic analysis.



1.  What is the Windows Registry, and what does it store?
   The Windows Registry is a database where Windows and other programs store their configuration settings.

2.  What are the two types of registry settings stored for each Windows user account?
   HKCU and HKU

3.  What are "registry hacks" and why might someone want to use them?
   Registry hacks are tweaks where you can edit the registry yourself to enable hidden features.

4.  What are some common tasks you can perform by editing the Windows Registry?
   Block user accounts from running specific apps, enable Windows Defender secret crapware blocker, display a message at sign-in, disable SMBv1

5.  Imagine you're explaining the concept of the Windows Registry to someone who has never used a computer before. How would you make this explanation culturally relevant and relatable to their life experiences or background?
   I would draw an analogy to the Windows registry being like a safe. A lot of people keep personal documents such as birth certificate, social security cards, death certificates, and other important information in their safe. So the safe would be Windows Registry and your documents are the settings. There are different ones for each memeber of the household.
